# Gofalu am Geredigion | Caring for Ceredigion

## Milestone Project 3

This website has been created to advertise and support volunteering opportunities in Ceredigion, a rural, coastal county in west Wales.

Volunteering opportunities are grouped into three categories: animals, environment, and people.

Users to the site will be able to view a board of live opportunities and apply for them via a form. The backend of the website will support the storage of the data they provide (via a database) so that it can be passed on to the institutions or bodies providing the opportunities.

The website will also provide information about former successful candidates to various schemes and will detail their experiences.

## Features
### Clean structure
The website is designed to give the user a great experience and to be user-friendly on all types of devices. There will be no difference in the experience users have when on a mobile compared to a laptop. The front-end code will utilize a combination of Materialize themes and elements to achieve this.

### Logo
The logo has been made through adapting Fontawesome Icons that will then be used throughout the site to denote the different catagories of voluntary oppertunities.

### Hero Image
The hero image will utilize the zoom animation from the 'Love Running' project and the colors have inspired the color palette.

### Color Palette
The colours were sampled in Gimp and then fine-tuned using Coolors. The feel is fresh, spring like and intended to be very easy to read.
